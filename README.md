This project is an AI-powered Study Assistant designed to help users create personalized mnemonics to improve their memory retention. By integrating powerful language models, the app generates creative and engaging mnemonics tailored to the user’s preferences, including their favorite movie, preferred mnemonic style, and desired language.

## Key Features

*Personalized Mnemonics:* Generate mnemonics based on your favorite movie, making it easier to associate concepts with themes you already love.

*Multiple Mnemonic Styles:* Choose from Acronym, Rhyme, or Storytelling styles to match your learning preferences.

*Language Support:* Generate mnemonics in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Hindi.

*User-Friendly Interface:* The Streamlit-powered interface ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## How It Works

The user provides an answer they want to remember, their favorite movie, and selects their preferred mnemonic style and language.

A custom prompt is generated based on the input and passed to the language model.

The model generates a mnemonic based on the input parameters, which is then displayed to the user.


## Inspiration

As an engineer, I’ve always found mnemonics to be a powerful tool for memorizing complex concepts, equations, or processes. However, creating effective mnemonics can be time-consuming. This project was born out of the desire to simplify that process by leveraging AI to generate mnemonics tailored to individual preferences and styles. By integrating elements of personal interest, such as favorite movies, the generated mnemonics become more memorable and enjoyable.
